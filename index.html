				Catherine II (Russian: Екатери́на Алексе́евна, romanized: Yekaterina
				Alekseyevna; 2 May [O.S. 21 April] 1729 – 17 November [O.S. 6 November]
				1796), also known as Catherine the Great (Екатери́на Вели́кая, Yekaterina
				Velikaya), born Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, was Empress of Russia
				from 1762 until 1796, the country's longest-ruling female leader. She
				came to power following a coup d'état that she organised—resulting in
				her husband, Peter III, being overthrown. Under her reign, Russia was
				revitalised; it grew larger and stronger and was recognised as one of
				the great powers of Europe.

				In her accession to power and her rule of the empire, Catherine often
				relied on her noble favourites, most notably count Grigory Orlov and
				Grigory Potemkin. Assisted by highly successful generals such as
				Alexander Suvorov and Pyotr Rumyantsev, and admirals such as Fyodor
				Ushakov, she governed at a time when the Russian Empire was expanding
				rapidly by conquest and diplomacy. In the south, the Crimean Khanate was
				crushed following victories over the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish
				wars, and Russia colonised the territories of Novorossiya along the
				coasts of the Black and Azov Seas. In the west, the Polish–Lithuanian
				Commonwealth, ruled by Catherine's former lover, King Stanisław August
				Poniatowski, was eventually partitioned, with the Russian Empire gaining
				the largest share. In the east, Russia started to colonise Alaska,
				establishing Russian America.
